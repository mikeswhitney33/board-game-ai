# Board Game Arena

"Board Game Arena" is a comprehensive Python project that combines the joy of classic board games with the thrill of playing against intelligent computer opponents. This project offers a collection of meticulously crafted implementations of popular board games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Reversi (also known as Othello).

## Features

- **Classic Board Games**: Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Reversi.
- **Human vs Human**: Challenge your friends or family in friendly matches.
- **Human vs AI**: Pit your skills against intelligent computer opponents powered by advanced algorithms.
- **AI Modes**:
  - **Monte Carlo Tree Search**: A sophisticated tree-based search algorithm for complex game situations.
  - **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A classic game-theoretic algorithm for optimal decision-making.
  - **Random Player**: A simple AI that makes random legal moves, ideal for beginners.
- **User-friendly Command-line Interface**: Easy navigation and game selection.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust game parameters to suit your preferences.
